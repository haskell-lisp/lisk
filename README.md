# Lisk

This Lisk project is the successor to the
[old project](https://github.com/haskell-lisp/historic-lisk)
started by Chris Done at the end of 2010. It used
[haskell-src-exts](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-src-exts)â€™s
AST and pretty printer in order to convert from Lisk to Haskell. Chris has
given his blessing to re-use the name for a new effort :-)

## Goals

100% compatibility/interop with Haskell (a la Erlang's
[LFE](http://lfe.github.io/) and [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/)).

## Current Status

Nothing but air. Some planning, some conversation; no code.

## Setting Up a Dev Environment

Dependencies:
 * Haskell
 * Stack

Run:

```
$ stack setup
$ stack build
```
