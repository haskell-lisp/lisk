# Lisk

This Lisk project is the successor to the
[old project](https://github.com/haskell-lisp/historic-lisk)
started by Chris Done at the end of 2010. Chris has given his blessing to
re-use the name for a new effort :-)

## Gaols

100% compatibility/interop with Haskell ala Erlang's
[LFE](http://lfe.github.io/) and
[Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/).

## Current Status

Nothing but air. Some planning, some conversation; no code.
